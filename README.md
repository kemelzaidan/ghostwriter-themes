# Ghostwriter Markdown Editor JSON Themes

Most ghostwriter themes I found on the Internet were .cfg TOML files but it seems that Ghostwriter moved theme configuration to JSON after version 2.0. So I decided to put this repository online.

The Dracula theme is from the [Dracula] project. Catppuccin theme files were downloade from the [Catppuccin] repository. Since both projects were licensed under MIT, I'm allowed to redistribute them here.

Solarized and Gruvbox themes were authored by me based on [Solarized] and [Gruvbox] projects and are also licensed under MIT.
